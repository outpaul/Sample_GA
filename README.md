This Genetic Algorithm gets you your target string in a finite number of generations.

It implements elitism for selection of parents i.e. the top 50% of the population breed and the top 10% are carried onto the next generation without any tampering. We use crossover for evolution and there is a 10% chance of mutation occurring on every gene.
